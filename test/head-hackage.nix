# How haskell.nix's own tests consume head.hackage.
#
# `test/cabal.project.local` keeps head.hackage's real url and root keys, so
# that a plain `cabal` build driven by that file still uses the published
# repository.  haskell.nix does not: it builds the repository itself (see
# overlays/head-hackage.nix), because the published one is regenerated on a
# schedule and is not reproducible, so a `--sha256` pin against it went stale
# roughly daily.
#
# Both the url and the root keys are rewritten here rather than weakened in the
# checked-in file, which stays correct for everyone who is not going through
# haskell.nix.  The locally built copy is signed with keys generated at build
# time, so the published root keys cannot apply to it.

      # boot packages are injected as `packages:` sources, and the boot deps
      # are pinned to the versions its own stage2 project uses.  Both then

      # (1) The ghcjs overlay is a package repository activated with
      # `:override`, so for every package it carries it replaces hackage
      # outright -- that is what it is for, patching packages that do not build
      # for the JS backend.  It carries `unix-2.8.1.0`; the pins ask for
      # `unix ==2.8.8.0`; the injected boot project's `Cabal` needs `unix` on
      # any non-Windows host:

      # stanza, so the file still declares the same repositories and a plain
      # `cabal` run driven by it is unaffected.
      #
      # (2) `constraints: ghci installed` cannot hold when nothing is
      # installed.  `libraries/ghci` is one of the injected boot packages, so
      # it is a local source package and the only `ghci` at the right version:

      # so the JS external interpreter has it for Template Haskell, which is
      # just as true here -- only the demand that it come pre-installed is
      # wrong.
      #
