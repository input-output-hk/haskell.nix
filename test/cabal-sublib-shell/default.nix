# The v1 (Setup.hs-based) builder used to synthesize ghc-pkg confs
# for public sublibraries that were missing `package-name:` and
# `lib-name:`.  With that missing, an unpatched cabal-install's
# solver treats the installed sublib unit as unusable and rebuilds
# the sublib from source inside the project.  This rebuild defeats
# the whole point of using the shell's pre-built deps.
#
# Structure:
#   - provider: has a main library and a `visibility: public` sublib `slib`.
#   - consumer: an executable that depends on `provider` and `provider:slib`.
#
# Test: spin up the project's shell, drop into it, run `cabal v2-build
# consumer` with the shell's own `cabal` (whatever `shell.tools.cabal`
# resolves to — that is deliberately not pinned here, so the test also
# covers the shell handing out a cabal-install that disagrees with the
# slices; see `builder/shell-for-v2.nix`'s `cabalTool`), and inspect
# the build log.  If cabal built `provider` or the `slib` sublib from
# source, the sibling bug is present.
