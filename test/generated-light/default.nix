# Verify that the lightweight `generated-light` derivation (hadrian's generated
# sources — primops / deriveConstants / config — built WITHOUT compiling all of
# GHC) produces output byte-identical to the `generated` files harvested from a
# full GHC build.
#
# `generated-light` is what `useLocalGhcLib` / `ghc-lib-reinstallable` and
# `ghc-boot-packages` consume at evaluation time (see overlays/ghc-packages.nix,
# modules/cabal-project.nix).  If its generators ever drifted from the full
# build's, `lib:ghc` would be miscompiled with no other warning — this test is
# the guard.
#
# It is cheap in CI: the full compiler is already a hydra root, so its
# `generated` output costs nothing extra; this only adds the (fast)
# `generated-light` build plus a comparison.
# `evalPackages` and `testSrc` are unused but always supplied by `callTest`.
