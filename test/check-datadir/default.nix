  # A stable-haskell `-target` cross compiler builds its boot libraries from
  # source (`emptyGlobalPackageDb`), and modules/cabal-project.nix hard-sets
  # `builderVersion = 2` for those projects — deliberately not `mkDefault`,
  # so that asking for the v1 builder fails loudly rather than producing a
  # subtly broken rts.  Asking anyway is what this test's v1 arm does, and it
  # gets what that comment promises:
  #
  #   error: The option `builderVersion' has conflicting definition values:
  #   - In `haskell.nix/modules/cabal-project.nix': 2
  #   - In `<unknown-file>': 1
  #
  # So drop the v1 arm there and keep `run-v2`, which is the arm that matters
  # anyway (the v1 `check` runs the test through Setup.hs, which already
  # staged the data-dir; v2 runs the installed binary and has to set
  # `<pkg>_datadir` itself).  Keyed on the capability rather than the compiler
  # name, like the guards in test/call-cabal-project-to-nix and
  # test/ghcjs-overlay, so the next such compiler needs no edit.
