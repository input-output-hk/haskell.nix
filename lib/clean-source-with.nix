# This is a replacement for the cleanSourceWith function in nixpkgs
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/1d9d31a0eb8e8358830528538a391df52f6a075a/lib/sources.nix#L41
# It adds a subDir argument in a way that allows descending into a subdirectory
# to compose with cleaning the source with a filter.
{ lib }: rec {

  # Like `builtins.filterSource`, except it will compose with itself,
  # allowing you to chain multiple calls together without any
  # intermediate copies being put in the nix store.
  #
  #     lib.cleanSourceWith {
  #       filter = f;
  #       src = lib.cleanSourceWith {
  #         filter = g;
  #         src = ./.;
  #       };
  #     }
  #     # Succeeds!
  #
  #     builtins.filterSource f (builtins.filterSource g ./.)
  #     # Fails!
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  #   src:      A path or cleanSourceWith result to filter and/or rename.
  #
  #   filter:   A function (path -> type -> bool)
  #             Optional with default value: constant true (include everything)
  #             The function will be combined with the && operator such
  #             that src.filter is called lazily.
  #             For implementing a filter, see
  #             https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#builtin-filterSource
  #
  #   subDir:   Descend into a subdirectory in a way that will compose.
  #             It will be as if `src = src + "/${subDir}` and filters
  #             already applied to `src` will be respected.
  #
  #   name:     Optional name to use as part of the store path.
  #             If you do not provide a `name` it wil be derived
  #             from the `subDir`. You should provide `name` or
  #             `subDir`.  If you do not a warning will be displayed
  #             and the name used will be `source`.
  #
  #   caller:   Name of the function used in warning message.
  #             Functions that are implemented using `cleanSourceWith`
  #             (and forward a `name` argument) can use this to make
  #             the message to the use more meaningful.
