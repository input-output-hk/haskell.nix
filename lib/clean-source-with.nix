# This is a replacement for the cleanSourceWith function in nixpkgs
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/1d9d31a0eb8e8358830528538a391df52f6a075a/lib/sources.nix#L41
# It adds a subDir argument in a way that allows descending into a subdirectory
# to compose with cleaning the source with a filter.
{ lib }: rec {

  # Like `builtins.filterSource`, except it will compose with itself,
  # allowing you to chain multiple calls together without any
  # intermediate copies being put in the nix store.
  #
  #     lib.cleanSourceWith {
  #       filter = f;
  #       src = lib.cleanSourceWith {
  #         filter = g;
  #         src = ./.;
  #       };
  #     }
  #     # Succeeds!
  #
  #     builtins.filterSource f (builtins.filterSource g ./.)
  #     # Fails!
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  #   src:      A path or cleanSourceWith result to filter and/or rename.
  #
  #   filter:   A function (path -> type -> bool)
  #             Optional with default value: constant true (include everything)
  #             The function will be combined with the && operator such
  #             that src.filter is called lazily.
  #             For implementing a filter, see
  #             https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#builtin-filterSource
  #
  #   subDir:   Descend into a subdirectory in a way that will compose.
  #             It will be as if `src = src + "/${subDir}` and filters
  #             already applied to `src` will be respected.
  #
  #   includeSiblings: By default the siblings trees of `subDir` are excluded.
  #             In some cases it is useful to include these so that
  #             relative references to those siblings will work.
  #
  #   name:     Optional name to use as part of the store path.
  #             If you do not provide a `name` it will be derived
  #             from the `subDir`. You should provide `name` or
  #             `subDir`.  If you do not a warning will be displayed
  #             and the name used will be `source`.
  #
  #   caller:   Name of the function used in warning message.
  #             Functions that are implemented using `cleanSourceWith`
  #             (and forward a `name` argument) can use this to make
  #             the message to the use more meaningful.
  #
  # Nix <2.4 Suport with filterPath
  #
  # As of Nix >=2.4 filtering is now possible on all paths (including those in the store).
  # If you still need to support older versions of Nix and want to maximise cache hits for your project
  # you may want to consider using setting the `filterPath` attribute on `src` (must be done on
  # the original src not the output of another `cleanSourceWith`).
  #
  # To disable filtering completely replace:
  #
  #   src = ./.;
  #
  # with:
  #
  #   src = { outPath = ./.; filterPath = { path, ... }: path; };
  #
  # To disable filtering only when the path is in the store use (when Nix <2.4 is unable to filter it):
  #
  #   src = {
  #     outPath = ./.;
  #     filterPath = { path, ... }@args:
  #       if builtins.hasContext (toString path) then path else builtins.path args;
  #   };
  #
  # Currently `haskell-nix.hackage-project` (used by `hackage-package`, `tool` and `tools`) disables
  # filtering.  See `overlays/haskell.nix` for details.
  #
  # For more see https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/pull/1418
