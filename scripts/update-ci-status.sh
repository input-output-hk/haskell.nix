# Regenerate the "Compiler CI status" table in README.md from the latest
# `master` builds on https://ci.zw3rk.com.
#
# The table reflects the `roots.ghc` Hydra jobs (i.e. GHC itself) for each
# compiler and platform.  cache.zw3rk.com holds the outputs of these builds, so
# a ✅ here means that compiler/platform is cached.
#
# Rather than downloading a whole evaluation (thousands of jobs, a heavy and
# flaky request), we query each job individually via
#   /job/<project>/<jobset>/<job>/latest
# which cheaply redirects to that job's most recent build.  A 404 means the job
# does not exist for that pin/host/target/compiler and is simply left blank in
# the table.  A build only counts as ✅ if it succeeded *and* belongs to the
# current evaluation (see the freshness check in ci-status.jq): an in-progress
# rebuild shows as building, while a job the current evaluation no longer
# includes renders as a blank cell, so we never advertise a stale green.
#
# The set of columns (COMPILERS) and rows (PLATFORMS) below is the CI matrix we
# advertise.  When a GHC version, cross target, or nixpkgs pin is added to or
# removed from CI (see ci.nix and docs/reference/supported-ghc-versions.md),
# update these lists to match.  Per-compiler gaps within a platform (e.g. no
# wasm build for an older GHC) do not need listing here — they are discovered
# automatically because the corresponding job 404s.
#
# Only README.md is touched, and only when the rendered table differs from
# what is already there — so running this on an unchanged CI status is a no-op
# and produces no commit.
#
# Requires: bash, curl, jq (>= 1.6).  No Nix evaluation.
