# Manually generating Nix expressions

We believe that imports from derivations (IFDs) provide tremendous
value in nix and the aversion towards them stems mostly from
poor tooling and ci support for them.  We do not believe
that poor tooling or ci support should cripple nix capability
of abstraction.  Hence haskell.nix makes excessive use of
IFDs.

We do note however that there are users who prefer to
have IFD-free expressions.  For this group of users we
detail how to expand the IFD dependent high level functions
into their IFD free building blocks.

The general structure will be the same, independent of the use of
Stack or Cabal.

Let us assume for now that we have already generated a `pkgs.nix`
expression (see the links bellow). The following file then produces a package set:

```nix
# default.nix
let
  # Import the Haskell.nix library,
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> (import (builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/archive/master.tar.gz) {}).nixpkgsArgs;

  # Import the file you will create in the stack-to-nix or cabal-to-nix step.
  my-pkgs = import ./pkgs.nix;

  # Stack projects use this:
  pkgSet = pkgs.haskell-nix.mkStackPkgSet {
    stack-pkgs = my-pkgs;
    pkg-def-extras = [
      # these extras will provide additional packages
      # ontop of the package set.  E.g. extra-deps
      # for stack packages. or local packages for
      # cabal.projects
    ];
    modules = [
      # specific package overrides would go here
      # example:
      #  packages.cbors.package.ghcOptions = "-Werror";
      #  packages.cbors.patches = [ ./one.patch ];
      #  packages.cbors.flags.optimize-gmp = false;
      # It may be better to set flags in stack.yaml instead
      # (`stack-to-nix` will include them as defaults).
    ];
  };

  # Cabal projects use this:
  pkgSet = pkgs.haskell-nix.mkCabalProjectPkgSet {
    plan-pkgs = my-pkgs;
    pkg-def-extras = [];
    modules = [
      # specific package overrides would go here
      # example:
      #  packages.cbors.package.ghcOptions = "-Werror";
      #  packages.cbors.patches = [ ./one.patch ];
      #  packages.cbors.flags.optimize-gmp = false;
      # It may be better to set flags in `cabal.project` instead
      # (`plan-to-nix` will include them as defaults).
    ];
  };

in pkgSet.config.hsPkgs // { _config = pkgSet.config; }
```

With this setup you can then start building the components of
interest:

```bash
nix build -f default.nix $pkg.components.library
```

to build the library for `$pkg` or

```bash
nix build -f default.nix $pkg.components.exes.$exe
```

to build a specific executable. The same holds for test suites and benchmarks.

## Using Stack

With [nix-tools installed](./installing-nix-tools.md), we can simply run the
following command on a stack project:

```bash
stack-to-nix --output . --stack-yaml stack.yaml
```

This will produce a `pkgs.nix` file that looks like the following:
```nix
{
  resolver = "lts-12.17";
  extras = hackage:
    {
      packages = {
        "o-clock" = hackage.o-clock."0.1.1".revisions.default;
        ...
      } // {
        my-package = ./my-package.nix;
        ...
      };
    };
}
```

This file contains the stackage resolver, as well as set of extra
packages.  The extras specifies which `extra-deps` (here:
`o-clock-0.1.1`) we wanted to add over the stackage snapshot, and what
local packages we want (here: `my-package`).

## Using Cabal

### Generating `plan.json`

To get a plan, you need Cabal and GHC. See the [How to install a
compiler section of the Nixpkgs Manual][compiler] for information
about how to choose a specific compiler version.

[compiler]: https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#how-to-install-a-compiler

!!! note "Cabal version"
    The minimum Cabal version is 2.4. This version is available
    in the NixOS 19.03 release.

For this example, we will run a `nix-shell` with the default GHC
version for Nixpkgs.

```bash
nix-shell -p haskellPackages.cabal-install haskellPackages.ghc \
    --run "cabal new-configure"
```

If all goes well, you should now have the file
`dist-newstyle/cache/plan.json`.

!!! tip "Specifying the GHC version"
    To use a specific compiler version, replace `haskellPackages.ghc`
    with something like `haskell-nix.compiler.ghc865`. The given compiler
    must exist in your Nixpkgs version, of course. See also the
    [Nixpkgs Manual][compiler].

### Using `plan-to-nix`

With [nix-tools installed](./installing-nix-tools.md), we can then run the
following command on a Cabal project and its build plan. Omit the
`--cabal-project` option if you don't have a project file.

```bash
# convert the plan.json file into a pkgs.nix file
plan-to-nix --output . \
    --plan-json dist-newstyle/cache/plan.json
    --cabal-project cabal.project
```

This will produce a `pkgs.nix` file that looks like the following:

```nix
{
  pkgs = hackage:
    {
      packages = {
        "o-clock" = hackage.o-clock."0.1.1".revisions.default;
        ...
      };
      compiler = { ... };
    };

  extras = hackage:
    { packages = { my-package = ./.plan.nix/my-package.nix; }; };
}
```

It has converted Cabal's build plan into a Nix expression that selects
dependencies from `hackage.nix`. All local packages in the project are
generated with `cabal-to-nix` and added to the package set
description.
