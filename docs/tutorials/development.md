Haskell.nix also provides reproducible development environments for
your Haskell projects. These environments can contain not only GHC and
your Haskell package dependencies, but also the required system
libraries and build tools.

Inside the development shell, you can run commands such as `ghc`,
`ghci`, or `cabal new‑build` (`cabal build` on Cabal 3.0),
and they will have all dependencies available.

Every dependency will be cached in your Nix store. If you have set up
Hydra CI, then your team can share pre-built dependencies.

These examples assume that you have created your package set as
described in [Creating Nix builds for your projects](getting-started.md) and
it exists in a file called `default.nix`.

## How to get a development shell

If you have a Cabal or Stack project with one or more packages
(i.e. multiple `.cabal` files, not a single package with multiple
components), then you will need a development environment that
contains the _dependencies_ of your packages, but not the packages
themselves. This is what the [`shellFor`][shellFor] function does.

```nix
{{#include development/shell.nix}}
```

See also: [Haskell.nix Library Reference: `shellFor`][shellFor]

[shellFor]: ../reference/library.md#shellfor

## How to get a local Hoogle index

If you need a local Hoogle for all the dependencies of your project create this file

```nix
{{#include development/shell-hoogle.nix}}
```

and run `nix-shell shell-hoogle.nix --run "hoogle server --local"`.
This will open a local Hoogle server at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.


## How to get an ad-hoc development shell including certain packages

This creates a development environment with the given packages
registered in the package database. The `ghcWithPackages` function
operates on a Haskell.nix package set, and accepts an argument that
selects packages from the larger package set.

```nix
{{#include development/shell-package.nix}}
```

If you need a Hoogle documentation index, use `ghcWithHoogle` in place
of `ghcWithPackages`.

## How to get packages from a certain Stackage snapshot

Haskell.nix knows about every released Stackage snapshot. You can use
it to build packages from a given snapshot, without setting up a full
project.

```nix
{{#include development/shell-stackage.nix}}
```

There are Haskell.nix package sets for every Stackage snaphot under
`haskell.snapshots`.

The alias `haskell.haskellPackages` corresponds to the package set for
a recent LTS Haskell version.

You can use `ghcWithPackages` on any of these package sets to quickly
get a shell with some packages.

> ⚠️ **Warning:**
>
> The build will not work if your Nixpkgs does not contain the version
> of GHC specified in the snapshot. Nixpkgs only carries the
> latest version of each recent release series, so many snapshots
> can't be built.


## Emacs IDE support

Once you have a development shell, then you can begin configuring
Emacs to use it. The way I do it is:

1. Run [lorri watch](https://github.com/target/lorri) to continuously
   build the shell environment and maintain GC roots.

2. Use [emacs‑direnv](https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv) to
   push the development environment into Emacs.

3. Use [Dante](https://github.com/jyp/dante) for highlighting errors
   and auto-completion. You must customize Dante to prevent it from
   automatically using `nix‑shell` or `stack`. Trim `dante‑methods` to
   just `new‑build` and `bare‑ghci`.

    You can also use [`.dir‑locals.el`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
    for this. If your project has multiple targets, set `dante‑target`
    per-directory.

4. For [`haskell‑mode`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode)
   interactive Haskell, set `haskell‑process‑type` to
   `cabal‑new‑repl`.

## Using `nix repl`

It's sometimes useful to load [Haskell.nix][] in the [REPL](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-repl.html) to explore
attrsets and try examples.

```
# example.nix
{ nixpkgs ? <nixpkgs> }:
rec {
  haskell = import nixpkgs (import (builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/archive/master.tar.gz) {}).nixpkgsArgs;
  pkgNames = haskell.pkgs.lib.attrNames haskell.haskell-nix.snapshots."lts-13.18";
}
```

Load the example file:

```
$ nix repl
Welcome to Nix 2.10.3. Type :? for help.

nix-repl> :l <nixpkgs>
Added 16938 variables.

nix-repl> :l example.nix
Added 2 variables.

nix-repl> lib.take 5 pkgNames
[ "AC-Angle" "ALUT" "ANum" "Agda" "Allure" ]

nix-repl> :q
```

Now that you have `nix-tools` and are able to import [Haskell.nix][],
you can continue to the next chapter.
