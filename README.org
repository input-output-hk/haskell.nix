* Alternative Haskell Infrastructure for Nixpkgs

[[https://travis-ci.org/input-output-hk/haskell.nix][https://travis-ci.org/input-output-hk/haskell.nix.svg?branch=master]]

=haskell.nix= is an experimental new builder for Haskell packages.

It works by automatically translating your Cabal or Stack project and
its dependencies into Nix code. Most of your dependencies are already
translated, so you generally won't have too much generated code.

For the documentation, see https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/.

** Quickstart

This will download and build =nix-tools=.

#+begin_src sh
nix build -f https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/archive/master.tar.gz nix-tools -o nt
./nt/bin/cabal-to-nix --help
#+end_src

** Related repos

The =haskell.nix= repository contains the runtime system for building
Haskell packages in Nix. It depends on other repos, which are:

- [[https://github.com/input-output-hk/nix-tools][nix-tools]] — provides the programs for generating Nix expressions from
  Haskell projects.

- [[https://github.com/input-output-hk/hackage.nix][hackage.nix]] — the latest contents of the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/][Hackage]] databases,
  converted to Nix expressions.

- [[https://github.com/input-output-hk/stackage.nix][stackage.nix]] — all of the [[https://www.stackage.org/][Stackage]] snapshots, converted to Nix
  expressions.
