# haskell.nix module that patches the `cabal-install` library used by
# nix-tools' `make-install-plan`.  Applied to both the regular
# nix-tools build (`nix-tools/overlay.nix`) and the static one
# (`nix-tools/static/project.nix`) — keeping the reference in one
# place so it can't drift between the two.
#
# The patch lives under `nix-tools/cabal-install-patches/` (rather
# than the top-level `builder/cabal-install-patches/` where the v2
# slice patches sit) so the relative path stays inside the
# nix-tools source tree: `cabalProject'` copies `src = ./.` (the
# nix-tools dir) to the nix store, and any module path that points
# outside that copy resolves to `/nix/store/...` and trips
# `pure evaluation mode` on aarch64-darwin's static build.
#
# The patch makes `Distribution.Client.PackageHash`'s
# `hashedInstalledPackageId` consult `CABAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGE_ID_OS`,
# pinning the unit-id format to the *build* platform's OS.  Without
# it, plan-nix unit-ids fork from slice-build unit-ids whenever the
# eval system differs from the build system (e.g. evaluating on
# Darwin while building x86_64-linux derivations).
#
# The `Cabal-syntax-json` patch ports that package (source of the
# `cabal2json` exe, pulled via source-repository-package) to the
# stable-haskell cabal fork's Cabal-syntax 3.17 API, which dropped
# the constraint type parameter from CondTree/CondBranch.
#
# The `glob-literal-fast-path` patch stops `runDirFileGlob` listing a
# whole directory just to resolve a glob that is a literal filename.
# Every `packages:` entry is resolved through that code, so a
# cabal.project holding absolute paths into one large directory
# rescans that directory once PER ENTRY.  The ghc914-sh stage2 plan
# does exactly that: `replace-hackage-tarball-urls` rewrites 31 boot
# libraries to `/nix/store/<hash>-<name>-src`, so `make-install-plan`
# lists a ~362k-entry /nix/store 31 times.  Page-cached on a local
# disk that merely wastes a second or two; inside a nix-linux-builder
# VM, where /nix/store is a virtiofs share from the macOS host, each
# 2KB getdents64 is a round trip and the plan stops making observable
# progress at all — 77 seconds natively versus killed by
# max-silent-time on the builder.  A plain upstream bug (the comment
# beside the code already promises the behaviour), so it should go to
# cabal rather than live here indefinitely.
#
# NB `packages.Cabal.patches`, not `cabal-install`:
# Distribution.Simple.Glob lives in the Cabal library, which this
# project takes from the stable-haskell fork via
# source-repository-package (see ./cabal.project).
