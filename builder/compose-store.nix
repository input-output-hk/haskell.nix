# Compose a list of v2 slices into a single cabal-store layout.
#
# Each input slice has its store contents under `${slice}/store/`;
# this helper materialises them under `$out/<ghcDir>/...` (the same
# shape as a slice's own `store/` subdir) so the result can be
# dropped into `~/.cabal/store/` directly via `lndir`.
#
# Used by:
#   * comp-v2-builder.nix — to expose `.store` on each v2 slice
#     containing only that component's *dependencies*.
#   * shell-for-v2.nix    — to build the user-facing composed store
#     for the v2 shell.
