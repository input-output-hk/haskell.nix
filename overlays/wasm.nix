  # GHC's wasm backend still requires the haskell-wasm wasi-libc fork — GHC's
  # own toolchain (ghc-wasm-meta) ships a forked wasi-sdk and states plainly
  # that "Upstream wasi-sdk won't work yet"; the fork's patches are NOT
  # upstreamed.  The pinned rev (951e93b) and LLVM (21.1.8, via the
  # haskell-wasm llvm-project patch above) both already match exactly what the
  # current wasi-sdk fork uses, so nothing here is stale.
  #
  # Two things nonetheless break the build under the bumped nixpkgs:
  #  1. nixpkgs re-packaged its own wasilibc around a CMake build (wasi-sdk-32);
  #     `overrideAttrs` inherits cmake/ninja + their setup hooks, so
  #     cmakeConfigurePhase runs against the fork tree (Makefile only, no
  #     CMakeLists.txt) and aborts.  Reuse the base derivation ONLY for its
  #     stdenvNoLibc + cross-toolchain libc-bootstrap wiring, and drive the
  #     fork's own Makefile build explicitly (drop cmake/ninja, disable their
  #     hooks, give explicit configure/build/install phases).
  #  2. ghc-wasm-meta builds wasi-libc with the raw wasi-sdk clang; we build it
  #     through nixpkgs' cc-wrapper, which injects `-rtlib=compiler-rt`.
  #     clang-21 flags that as unused on `-c`-only steps, and the fork
  #     Makefile compiles with `-Werror` (EXTRA_CFLAGS precedes it, so a
  #     suppression there would lose to `-Werror`).  The cc-wrapper appends
  #     NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE AFTER the Makefile's flags, so demote it there.
