  # shared across every `mkGhc` / `evalWith` invocation.  These bindings depend
  # only on `pkgs`/`lib` and build/version constants — never on `evalSystem`
  # — so keeping a copy inside each `mkGhc` invocation (as we used to) re-built
  # the identical configured source tree per invocation, because `evalWith`
  # re-invokes `mkGhc` per eval system.  `mkConfiguredSrc`/`mkDumpSrc` here are
  # applied to a specific nixpkgs at each use: `configuredSrc`/`dumpSrc` (build
  # platform) once, and `configuredSrcEval`/`dumpSrcEval` (one mkGhc invocation's
  # eval platform) once — cross-eval-system reuse comes from `evalWith`.

  # identifies itself everywhere cabal can observe (--numeric-version, the

  # store dir name) as the MUNGED "9.14", so every haskell.nix-facing surface
  # (passthru.version, lib dir, versioned bin aliases) uses ghcVersion = the
  # munged form.  A "9.14.0" the plan-time dummy ghc reports but the real

  # it rewritten by `fixRtsWays`.  The same value is what the plan-time dummy
  # reports (lib/dummy-ghc.nix); `tests.dummy-ghc-info` diffs the two.
  shRtsWays = import ../lib/stable-haskell-rts-ways.nix;
  # `enableShared` is FALSE, and the stage2 boot libraries are built from
  # `cabal.project.stage2.static`.  This compiler ships no shared way of any
  # boot library, and now says so.
  #
  # The alternative -- make `enableShared` mean what DYNAMIC=1 means in the
  # fork's Makefile, i.e. build from `cabal.project.stage2.dynamic` -- was
  # tried (3f3cf0506, da6b6dae1) and reverted here.  Two things sink it, and
  # both are worth recording because neither is visible from the project
  # files:
  #
  #   * `cabal.project.stage2.dynamic` carries `constraints: rts +dynamic`,
  #     and rts.cabal turns that flag into `-DDYNAMIC` for EVERY way it
  #     builds, vanilla included (rts/rts.cabal `common
  #     rts-global-build-flags`).  `ghc --info`'s `GHC Dynamic` is not a
  #     settings field: it is `rts_isDynamic()`, i.e. `#if defined(DYNAMIC)`
  #     compiled into whichever rts the `ghc` binary links
  #     (rts/RtsUtils.c:421 → GHC.Platform.Ways.hostIsDynamic →
  #     GHC.Driver.Session:3573).  So a STATIC `ghc` built from that project
  #     reports `GHC Dynamic: YES` -- dropping `executable-dynamic` does not
  #     help -- and GHC then loads dynamic objects for Template Haskell and
  #     links against `libHS<dep>-ghc9.14.dylib` for every dependency, which
  #     v2 consumer plans (whose configure flags come from plan.json, not
  #     from this passthru) never built.  Hadrian gets this right by adding
  #     `-DDYNAMIC` per way; cabal has no per-way ghc-options, so the fork's
  #     project files must pick one, and they pick the one that suits a
  #     genuinely dynamic build.
  #
  #   * upstream's dynamic build only survives its dynamic EXECUTABLES because
  #     the Makefile's DYNAMIC=1 dist step repairs their rpaths afterwards
  #     (`SET_RPATH ../lib/$(HOST_PLATFORM)`, `patchelf --set-rpath $ORIGIN`).
  #     Nothing does that here, and the first casualty is not the assembled
  #     compiler but a tool cabal builds and RUNS INSIDE a slice: a
  #     dynamically-linked `alex` that dyld could not start, reported as
  #     `Error: [Cabal-1008] The program 'alex' ... could not be determined`.
  #
  # Cost of staying static: a v1 (comp-builder) consumer used to be told
  # `--enable-shared` by this passthru and then failed on the boot libraries'
  # missing dynamic way (`tests.check-datadir.run`: "Failed to load dynamic
  # interface file for Prelude ... base-4.22.0.0/Prelude.dyn_hi").  False is

  # `evalSystem` is the eval platform (as a system string) on which plan-to-nix

  # instead of `buildPackages` so plan evaluation can run on a platform other

  # machine running nix); `roots'` / `cabalProject'` rethread it by SELECTING
  # `ghc.evalWith.${evalSystem}` (overlays/haskell.nix) so that, e.g.,
  # `hydraJobs.x86_64-linux.…ghc914-sh.native.roots.ghc` evaluated on a darwin
  # host computes its plans on darwin instead of shipping the plan-to-nix
  # derivations to a linux builder.
  #
  # The whole compiler pipeline is a function of `evalSystem`; `evalWith`
  # (below) exposes the per-eval-system variants as a memoised attrset —
  # `evalWith.${evalSystem}` is `mkGhc { inherit evalSystem; }` — so selecting
  # one rebuilds the plans against that eval platform without re-running the
  # pipeline per call site (attribute selection is memoised, `.override` is not).
  #
  # Projects/tools derive their (read-only) `evalPackages` option from

  # ── Cross compiler: per-target wrapper around the native ghc914-sh ────────
  # The stable-haskell GHC is a runtime multi-target compiler: `ghc
  # -target=<triple>` (ghc/Main.hs) swaps the session topdir to
  # `$topdir/targets/<triple>/lib`, so a "cross compiler" is just the NATIVE
  # compiler plus a target registration: a `settings` file naming the cross
  # toolchain, a global `package.conf.d`, and the $topdir support files.
  # This derivation creates that registration inside a symlink copy of the
  # native compiler's tree and wraps the native binaries with
  # `-B<here> -target=<triple>` — no cross-targeting GHC is built at all.
  #
  # The target's global package.conf.d is EMPTY on purpose: unlike a hadrian
  # bindist this compiler ships no target boot libraries.  Each project's
  # cabal plan builds rts, base, … from source alongside the user's own
  # packages (the stable-haskell cabal fork's build/host stage system; the
  # boot sources are injected as a source-repository-package — see the
  # boot-package injection in modules/cabal-project.nix and the empty target
  # dummy dump in lib/call-cabal-project-to-nix.nix).

    # ── LLVM backend ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Two things the `-target` registration has to supply that a hadrian
    # bindist gets from its own build, and that nothing else here provides:
    #
    #   * `$topdir/llvm-targets` AND `$topdir/llvm-passes`, the two tables
    #     `GHC.Driver.Config.LlvmConfigCache` reads: triple -> (data layout,
    #     cpu, features) for the `llc` command line, and -O level -> `opt`
    #     `-passes=` string.  The `-target` session's topdir is $tdir/lib, so
    #     a copy under the NATIVE tree (which `lndir` brings in) is not where
    #     GHC looks, and the compile dies with
    #       .../targets/<triple>/lib/llvm-<file>: openFile: does not exist
    #     That is two files, and they failed the rts -- so all four rts ways,
    #     so every armv7a-android job.
    #
    #     Copy BOTH.  `initLlvmConfigCache` reads them under
    #     `unsafeInterleaveIO`, so they fail at first use rather than at
    #     startup, and their uses differ: llvm-targets is needed by every
    #     compile, llvm-passes only once `opt` runs -- i.e. only at -O.  That
    #     staggering is why fixing llvm-targets alone looked like it worked:
    #     the rts's unoptimised .cmm files compiled, and the first `-O` one
    #     then died on llvm-passes instead.
    #
    #   * absolute `llc`/`opt`/`llvm-as` paths.  ghc-toolchain hard-codes
    #     the bare names (`llc_cmd = "llc" -- FIXME`, ghc-toolchain's
    #     exe/Main.hs), GHC execs them from PATH, and nothing puts LLVM on a
    #     slice build's PATH.  It shows up only as the non-fatal
    #       Warning: Couldn't figure out LLVM version!
    #     immediately before the failure above, which is why the missing
    #     file is the visible symptom.  The hadrian compilers get the same
    #     absolute paths from `export LLC=/OPT=` in compiler/ghc/default.nix,
    #     which ./configure bakes into their settings.
    #
    #     `llvm-as` is NOT llvm-as.  Despite the setting name, GHC runs this
    #     one through `runGenericAsPhase` -- the same code path as the plain
    #     C-compiler assembler -- so it hands it `-fPIC -U__PIC__ -D__PIC__`,
    #     `-x assembler`, `-c`, `-o` and `-I` flags.  Those are clang driver
    #     flags; LLVM's actual `llvm-as` takes a single positional .ll and

    #   `CClockId` = `Word32` argument.  The `capi` shim GHC writes for it
    #   therefore hands an integer to a pointer parameter, and clang 21
    #   makes `-Wint-conversion` an ERROR by default:

    #   out as integers), so demoting the diagnostic is the fix, and it
    #   belongs in the toolchain because it is a property of wasi-libc, not
    #   of `time` -- every capi import of a wasi "handle" typedef hits it.
    #   `time` is a boot library, so this one error took out most of both
