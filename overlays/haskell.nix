              # Let's examine the steps above one by one.
              #
              # Step 1) is typically the result of calling `cabal update`. Because Haskell.nix supports
              # different ways of including extra repositories, we need to divide this step into two
              # other steps.
              #
              # 1a) Download the index tarball (01-index.tar.gz) and the TUF matadata (mirrors.json,
              #     root.json, snapshot.json, timestamp.json)
              # 1b) Decompress the index tarball and create additional index/cache files (01-index.cache,
              #     01-index.tar, 01-index.tar.idx, 01-index.timestamp)
              #
              # dotCabal supports pre-populating a CABAL_DIR from two kind of repositories:
              #
              # - extra-hackage-repos
              # - extra-hackage-tarballs
              #
              # These repositories are in addititon to hackage, which is always prepopulated.
              #
              # NOTE: this might not be 100% correct since cabal can work without hackage being defined
              # in the global configuration at all. As a workaround, a project that does not want to use
              # hackage can use an explicit `active-repositories:` in the project configuration.
              # Haskell.nix will prepopulate hackage in CABAL_DIR but then cabal will not use it for
              # project planning.
              #
              # Let's examine how we deal with these repositories.
              #
              # - hackage: Hackage index tarball is downloaded and truncated from hackage.haskell.org.
              #   Since this is only the tarball, we need to add the TUF files and we need to bootstrap
              #   it (both part of bootstrapIndexTarball called above). Additionally, cabal will always
              #   include hackage when creating a default global configuration, so we need to add it to
              #   the global cabal config as well.
              #
              # - extra-hackage-repos: The repos are parsed from the project configuration but the user
              #   is responsible for downloading the whole repo (not only the tarball but also the TUF
              #   files). The downloaded repository still needs to be bootstrapped but it's done in
              #   ./lib/cabal-project-parser.nix, before we get here. We don't need to add these
              #   repositories in cabal.config since they are already present in the project configuration.
              #
              # - extra-hackage-tarballs: These are index tarballs the user is asking haskell.nix to
              #   "inject" into the project. They work in a similar way to hackage, since they also need
              #   TUF files, bootstrap and to be added in the cabal configuration.
              #
              #                        |           |                 | needs to be added |
              #                        | needs TUF | needs bootstrap | to cabal.config   |
              # -----------------------+-----------+-----------------+-------------------+
              # hackage                | yes       | yes             | yes               |
              # extra-hackage-repos    | no        | already done    | no                |
              # extra-hackage-tarballs | yes       | yes             | yes               |
              # -----------------------+-----------+-----------------+-------------------+
              #
              # Step 2) is writing the global cabal config. cabal writes a default global configuration
              # file at any invocation if it is missing. This is a simple step but there is one trick
              # we need to be aware and careful about. cabal populates CABAL_DIR with repositories obtained
              # from somewhere (the repository's url). What we are doing here is prepopulating CABAL_DIR
              # for cabal, we do not want to change where cabal thinks a repository is coming from.
              #
              # E.g. after prepopulating CABAL_DIR/packages/hackage.haskell.org from the nix path
              # /nix/store/ff4pn0yva7ndsrg2zshy8qxzlrfsr4cl-cabal-bootstrap-index-tarball-hackage.haskell.org/
              # the configuration we want to write is still
              #
              #   repository hackage.haskell.org
              #     url: http://hackage.haskell.org
              #     secure: True
              #
              # and not
              #
              #   repository hackage.haskell.org
              #     url: file:/nix/store/ff4pn0yva7ndsrg2zshy8qxzlrfsr4cl-cabal-bootstrap-index-tarball-hackage.haskell.org/
              #     secure: True
              #
              # Doing this correctly is important for few reasons:
              #
              # 1. cabal as called by haskell.nix will produce exactly the same install plan as cabal
              #    called outside of haskell.nix (other things equal, of course)
              # 2. The url of the repositories will be visible in the install plan. Having the correct
              #    urls there will allow us to know from where to fetch the packages tarballs at build
              #    time.
              # 3. We don't want to leak the nix path of the index into the derivation of the component
              #    builder since this will cause unnecessary recompilation. In other words, the recipe to
              #    compile a package has to only depend on its content, not on where the recipe is from
              #    or how it is obtained.
              #
              # Using the correct url for the repository is only possible if the url is well-known. Again
              # there is a difference in this regard among the different kind of repositories.
              #
              # - hackage: hackage's url is always well known.
              # - extra-hackage-repos: since the user is responsible for downloading these repositories,
              #   we don't really know where they are from, BUT, we also don't have to include them in
              #   cabal.config because the user has already included them in the project configuration.
              # - extra-hackage-tarballs: this is just a tarball passed to haskell.nix, we have no idea
              #   if the corresponding repository is published anywhere. The best we can do in this case
              #   is to form a url from the key of the extra-hackage-tarball and leave the user to decide.
              #   The user could use a key corresponding to a real reository domain or overwrite the
              #   packages source manually.
              #   E.g. passing
              #
              #     extra-hackage-tarballs = { extra-hackage-demo = ./01-index.tar.gz; };
              #
              #   will produce in cabal.config
              #
              #     repository extra-hackage-demo
              #       url: http://extra-hackage-demo/
              #       secure: True
              #
              #   and any package from that index will have a source url like
              #
              #   http://extra-hackage-demo/package/external-package-demo-0.1.0.0.tar.gz
              #
              #   If "extra-hackage-demo" is not a real domain, the user can correct those source urls
              #   while calling cabalProject
              #
              #   modules = [
              #     { packages.external-package-demo.src = demo-src; }
              #   ];
              #
              # In summary:

            #
            # These shells are added to the main shell using the `inputsFrom` argument.
            #
            # Without `crossPlatforms` the above example would be:
            #   let project = import ./. {};
            #   in project.shellFor {
            #     tools.cabal = {};
